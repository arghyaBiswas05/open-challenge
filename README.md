# open-challenge
I have a open-challenge for all of you. I have a executable binary for intel architecture as well as a ARM architecture. This is a simple license checking binary. When you run the binary it will ask for the license key. If you provide the correct license key it will show a “access granted” message, otherwise it will denied your access.

Now I am not going to provide the license key to you. So your work is to crack the binary. You have two choice. You may find the license key or you may tempered the binary and grant the access. Its your choice, I need the access only.
